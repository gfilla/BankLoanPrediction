## Running the Dashboard

### Load R.zip to your RStudio - Managing dependencies

0. [Get a Data Science Experience account (it's free!)](https://datascience.ibm.com/)
1. [Download the R.zip here](https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/fd8vgznfuv3x6rrx65vnxh4sj2chd7la.zip).
2. In your RStudio environment click `Upload`  then select the R.zip

Note: This will take some time to complete

3. Click yes to the prompt about overwriting (unless you have R packages in your R directory you need to keep)

4. Restart R!

Now you are using the same package versions I used when developing the dashboard.

### Commands to run dashboard:

```r
# clone this repository to your RStudio
system("git clone https://github.com/gfilla/BankLoanPrediction.git")

# find the R markdown file and run
rmarkdown::run("BankLoanPrediction/dashboard/bankPredictionWML.Rmd")

```

---

### Challenges

1. Add new tab to the dashboard called `Data` with a view of the dataframe `testScores`
2. Replace the JSON output with visualization of your choice

---

### Hints:

1. Check out renderDataTable
2. Start by duplicating the viz in the demo and check out this [Plotly book](https://plotly-book.cpsievert.me/) to help find interesting plots
